# Redesigning the Saurashtra Abugida

I propose a framework for creating a more optimal Saurashtra abugida than T.M. Rama Rai's attempt in the late 19th century.

## Voiced Consonants

Saurashtra uses both voiced and non-voiced phonemes, but T.M. Rama Rai adopts the Devanagari standard of differentiating between both the phonemes with different graphemes.

I propose that the Saurashtra abugida should ==reserve one grapheme for both voiced and non-voiced phonemes== and ==differentiate between both with a standard diacritic== because ==non-voiced consonants become voiced when you use your vocal cords==.

## Aspirated Consonants

Saurashtra uses both aspirated and non-aspirated phonemes, but T.M. Rama Rai adopts the Devanagari standard of differentiating between both the phonemes with different graphemes.

I propose that the Saurashtra abugida should ==reserve one grapheme for both aspirated and non-aspirated phonemes== and ==differentiate between both with a standard diacritic== because ==non-aspirated consonants become aspirated when you exhale==.

## Vibrated Consonants

- #question Is there a link between the phonemes (`j` and `ʒ`) and (`ch` and `sh`)?
