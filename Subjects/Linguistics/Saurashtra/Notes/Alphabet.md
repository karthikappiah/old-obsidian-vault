# Designing the Saurashtra Alphabet

I propose a standard Saurashtra alphabet to facilitate the instruction of the Saurashtra language for Saurashtrians familiar with the English alphabet.

## Vowels

- Vowel length describes how short and long vowels are pronounced.
- Vowels can be lengthened with an accent.

## Consonants

- Consonants can be aspirated with `_h` digraphs.
	- I propose ignoring all default English `_h` digraphs for consistency.
	- I reserve `c` to replace the English phoneme `ch`.
	- I adopt `ş` to replace the English phoneme `sh`.
	- I adopt `þ` and `ð` to replace the Hindi phonemes  `त` and `द`.
